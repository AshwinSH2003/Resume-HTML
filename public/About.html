     <h1>About me</h1>
     <p>My name is Ashwin S H, and I am currently pursuing Btech from KLE Technological University in the field of Computer Science and Engineering. I was born and raised in Dharwad, where I completed my schooling at JSS SMCS with 84 % and my secondary education at Prism PU College Dharwad with 84.5 %.
        My parents, both being engineering college professors, have instilled me with the values of hard work and dedication.
        </p>
        <p>
        I have maintained a strong CGPA of 8.72 and have actively participated in various projects which range from machine learning and computer vision projects like Automatic Road Density-Based Traffic Control System and Road Damage Detection, to full-stack web applications like SDG-based Travel and Tourism Web Application. These projects have provided me hands-on experience with programming languages like C, C++, and concepts of OOPS in real-world modelling.
        I have an in-depth knowledge in core concepts of computer science which include CN, OS, SDLC.

        Team leadership and decision-making abilities are my key strengths. Sometimes I tend me more perfectionist I spend a lot of time on some tasks but I am working on it by making to-do tasks and setting up deadlines.
        In my leisure time, I enjoy gardening and teaching, which help me improve my interpersonal skills. I believe my technical skills and passion for technology would make me an asset to your team.
